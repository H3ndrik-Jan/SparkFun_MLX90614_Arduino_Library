C Library for utilizing the MLX90614 IR sensor with atXMega256A3U
========================================
I changed sparkfuns library for use with an xmega256a3u, without using the arduino environment. Instead of using the Arduino Wire library for I2C communication, the library utilizes a i2c library which can be found in this book: https://www.dolman-wim.nl/xmega/index.php
